To test application:
```python mouse_trajectory.py```
and move mouse over the created plot.

Implementation of Kalman filter is in folder 'kf'. This implementation took from previous UCU course "Bayesian process".

File 'Mouse_trajectory_explanation.ipynb' contains description of the model.

File 'example' demonstrates how application works.
